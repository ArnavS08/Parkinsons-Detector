## Overview

The Parkinson's Detector project aims to provide a reliable tool for detecting Parkinson's disease through the analysis of various features extracted from patient data. The application processes raw data, extracts relevant features, and trains a machine learning model to make predictions.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/parkinsons-detector.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd parkinsons-detector
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the application, execute the following command:
```
python src/app.py
```

This will initiate the data loading, preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training processes.
