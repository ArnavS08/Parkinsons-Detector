A mobile based machine learning model for Parkinson's disease screening using smartphone sensors. The app captures voice recordings through your phone's microphone and tremor data via the accelerometer to analyze potential motor and vocal symptoms.
The dual modality approach combines audio analysis of speech patterns with movement detection from hand tremors, which provides a more comprehensive assessment than single feature methods. Built for accessibility and ease of use, no external equipment needed. 
Note: This is a research/educational tool and not a replacement for professional medical diagnosis.
